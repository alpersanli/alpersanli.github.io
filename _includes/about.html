  <button class="accordion">üî¨ MTF & PSF in Optical Systems</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) and Point Spread Function (PSF) are fundamental
      metrics for evaluating optical performance. MTF describes how contrast is preserved 
      across spatial frequencies, while PSF shows the distribution of light from a point 
      source. In telescope payload design, optimizing MTF and PSF directly improves image 
      sharpness and mission success in Earth observation.

  <button class="accordion">üì° RTL-SDR Experiments</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      RTL-SDR.com provides low-cost software-defined radio dongles, enabling reception 
      of a wide frequency range. With open-source software, they can be used for 
      weather satellite image decoding, aircraft tracking (ADS-B), and even 
      amateur radio astronomy experiments. A great entry point for exploring 
      the electromagnetic spectrum.

  <button class="accordion">üõ∞Ô∏è CubeSat Deployer Systems</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>
      CubeSat deployers such as P-PODs and newer deployer mechanisms are critical 
      for small satellite missions. They ensure safe deployment from launch vehicles 
      while protecting payloads. Innovations include spring-loaded systems, 
      sequenced release, and modular multi-satellite deployment. Their design 
      directly influences mission safety and orbital insertion accuracy.
