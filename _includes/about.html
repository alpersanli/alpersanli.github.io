        <p>The concepts of the Point Spread Function and the Modulation Transfer Function remain central to the evaluation of optical performance. The PSF characterizes the distribution of light from a single point source across the detector plane, providing a physical manifestation of the system‚Äôs resolution capability. The MTF, on the other hand, offers a frequency domain description that quantifies the system‚Äôs ability to preserve contrast across different levels of spatial detail. These two descriptions are not isolated, as the MTF is the Fourier transform of the PSF, and their combined interpretation enables a comprehensive understanding of imaging fidelity.</p>
        <p>In practical terms, PSF and MTF are not abstract constructs but rather essential tools in the design and validation of Earth observation payloads. Misalignments, figure errors, and structural deformations alter the PSF, thereby degrading the system MTF and reducing the effective resolution. The performance of a remote sensing telescope is therefore judged not only by theoretical diffraction limits but also by the stability of these functions under operational conditions. Careful design, simulation, and calibration are required to ensure that the measured MTF remains within mission requirements throughout the satellite lifetime.</p>

        <p>The introduction of low-cost software defined radios has created a unique environment for experimentation in communication and remote sensing. The RTL-SDR, although originally intended as a television tuner, has become a valuable platform for scientific exploration and engineering education. With a simple antenna and an open-source software stack, it is possible to observe aircraft transponders, receive weather satellite imagery, and monitor spectrum activity in real time. These experiments highlight the accessibility of signal processing and the importance of practical exposure to radio frequency systems.</p>
        <p>Beyond hobbyist applications, the use of RTL-SDR in research contexts demonstrates the value of low-barrier tools for prototyping. Lessons in noise characterization, frequency stability, and antenna optimization provide insights that scale directly into the design of professional ground stations. The device‚Äôs limitations in sensitivity and dynamic range become teaching moments in understanding trade-offs that govern radio system performance. Through this lens, RTL-SDR serves not only as a tool for experimentation but also as a bridge between theory and practice in modern communication engineering.</p>

        <p>The development of standardized deployer systems has played a decisive role in the success of CubeSat missions. These mechanisms are responsible for maintaining the structural integrity of small satellites during launch and for ensuring their safe release into orbit. The simplicity of the Poly-Picosatellite Orbital Deployer established a template that has since been adapted to accommodate increasingly complex payloads and mission scenarios. By reducing integration complexity and guaranteeing compatibility with multiple launch vehicles, deployers have become a critical enabler of accessible space exploration.</p>
        <p>Engineering challenges in deployer design extend well beyond the mechanical interface. The system must endure the severe acoustic and vibrational environment of launch while preventing inadvertent release. At the same time, it must guarantee a clean separation, minimizing tip-off rates and ensuring predictable satellite dynamics after deployment. Verification involves repeated testing under thermal vacuum and vibration conditions to replicate the operational environment. These considerations illustrate the importance of deployers not merely as containers but as sophisticated engineering systems whose reliability directly defines the success of CubeSat programs.</p>
